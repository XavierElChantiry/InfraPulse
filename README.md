# InfraPulse

## Introduction
Aside from an attempt at a catchy name, this project has the ansible and terraform needed to set up a simple web application. In this case its a web application that servies the contents of a RDS or local database.

## Getting started 
### Prerequisites
### Start Project

## Troubleshooting
mostly notes for my self,
they need working ansible and terraform
terraform needs to be logged into their aws

ansible needs to have the key for their aws

okay intro, setup, use, troubleshooting, 

some key seconds should be
explaining web app
explaining setup
step to install pre recs
fixing rds setup/troubleshooting

Mention how the app is setup so someone could reuse the db setup and the app sertup also mention the LB
